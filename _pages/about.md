Hello! My name is Walid Ghariani, and I am a recent MSc graduate in Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis from **[Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite/){:target="_blank"}** with a passion for geospatial data science and analytics. I am excited about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems and drive impactful decision-making.

During my academic and professional journey, I developed a strong foundation in **Spatial Data**, **Earth Observation**, **Programming**, **Statistics**, **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I have hands-on experience in **Data Manipulation**, **Data Visualisation**, and **Predictive Modeling** using Python and R. I thrive when faced with challenging problems, as I enjoy diving deep into research, conducting thorough data analysis, and immersing myself in the beauty of the data to bring high-quality geospatial and analytics solutions to businesses seeking higher efficiency. I am continuously expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest relevant programs through online courses, workshops, books and research publications.

Outside of work, I value the opportunity to create meaningful connections with people. I find great joy in engaging in genuine conversations, building relationships and a sense of community. I believe in the power of human connections and the valuable impact they can have on our lives.

## Skills and Expertise

This list represents some of the key tools and technologies that I work with and continuously enhance my skills in. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and I am always open to exploring and learning new technologies.
