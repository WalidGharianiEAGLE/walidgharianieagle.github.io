## Motivations

During my MSc thesis, I developed a Python package aimed at enhancing the reliability of cross-validation for spatial data. There seems to be a misconception regarding the appropriate choice of cross-validation strategy when conducting spatial predictions and evaluating machine learning algorithms. Many researchers often opt for random cross-validation or k-fold techniques, which fail to consider the spatial nature of the data and the presence of spatial autocorrelation [Bahn & McGill, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02881). Consequently, this approach may lead to an overly optimistic assessment of the model's performance and an overfitting issue. This is why I created this package, to address not only the issue of overfitting but also to provide a more reliable evaluation of model performance.

## Description

spatial-kfold is a python library for performing spatial resampling to ensure more robust cross-validation in spatial studies. It offers spatial clustering and block resampling techniques with user-friendly parameters to customize the resampling. It enables users to conduct a "Leave Region Out" cross-validation, which can be useful for evaluating the model's generalization to new locations as well as improving the reliability of feature selection [Meyer et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815) and hyperparameter tuning [Schratz et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.06.002) in spatial studies.


## Main Features

spatial-kfold allow to conduct "Leave Region Out" using two spatial resampling techniques:

* 1- Spatial clustering with kmeans
* 2- Spatial blocks
    * Random blocks
    * Continuous blocks 
        * tb-lr : top-bottom, left-right
        * bt-rl : bottom-top, right-left

## Installation

spatial-kfold can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spatial-kfold/)

```py
pip install spatial-kfold
```
